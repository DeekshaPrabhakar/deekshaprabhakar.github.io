                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a software engineer with a passion for building
                        products that make a difference. I have experience
                        working with startups and large corporations, and I am
                        always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was born and brought up in India. My undergrad major
                        was related to Electronics since I did not like Computer
                        Science. Generally there are 2 reasons you don't like
                        something:
                        <ol>
                            <li>You do not understand it OR</li>
                            <li>You are insecure about it.</li>
                        </ol>
                        For me it was the former. Luckily during one of the
                        microprocessor labs while programming a traffic light
                        control board I discovered my passion for programming.
                        It was like finding your one true love and everything
                        fell into its place, mostly üòâ
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rest is history. I am truly grateful each day that I can
                        say that <i>I love what I do for a living</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I like all things efficient, logical and productive. I
                        love my
